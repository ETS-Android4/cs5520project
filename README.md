## Features of this app
This is a to-do list app to help people recording their daily tasks. It includeds the following features:
1. Add a new to-do task, which can include a title, a description, a deadline, a tag, and setting a later reminder (alarm) for this task.
2. Update a to-do task.
3. Mark a task as completed.
4. Change the order of the created tasks and the order is preserved after restarting the app.
5. Filter the tasks by their names.
6. All the tasks are stored in a local Room database.

## Things to improve in the future:
1. Enable user to delete a task, which should be easy to implement and very useful for users of this app.


All in all, thanks a lot for all the help that I received while making this project, especially from Prof. Slaughter!
