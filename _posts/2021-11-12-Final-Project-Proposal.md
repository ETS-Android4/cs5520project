In the final project, I would like to add more features to the existing To-do list app. Currently, the To-do app supports adding, editing a new Task and setting notification at a desired time. All the tasks are stored in local Room database.

There are 3 major features/aspects that I would like to further develop on for the final demonstration:

1. UI of the app: I will try to learn to apply a Material Design UX to my To-Do app. Referecing material: https://material.io/design

2. Enable users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping.

3. Implement a small search feature of to do tasks, which can be filtering tasks by tags or searching them by key words.

In addition, there are small issues about the current app that I would like to fix on. For example, 1) enable deleting a task, and 2) crossing off a task to show that it is done and storing this info in the database.
