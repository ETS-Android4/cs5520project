In the final project, I would like to add more features to the existing To-do list app. Currently, the To-do app supports adding, editing a new Task and setting notification at a 
desired time.

There are 3 major features or aspects that I would like to develop on for the final demonstration:
1. UI of the app: I will try to learn applying a Material Design UX to my To-Do app. Referecing material: https://material.io/design

2. Enable users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping.

3. Implement a small search feature of to do tasks, which can be filtering by tags or searching by key words.

In addition, there are small issues about the current app that I would like to fix. For example, 1) enable deleting a task, and 2) crossing off a task to show that it is done and store this info in the database.
