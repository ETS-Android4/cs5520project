Within this assignment, I stored the deadline date and time within the task table in the database. Once the task is created, a reminder is set 
and it will notify users about the deadline at the deadline time. However, I am still figuring out how to add reminders to the WorkManager. I also found out that WorkManager does not support executing a work at an exact time. I am considering whether I should use other ways to implement it. 

Current version of the app is shown in the video below.
