During this lesson, I have learnt the lifecycle of an activity when interacts with other activities and how to restore a View instance state after screen rotating. 

Here are two images of what I built following the lesson.

Here are the results of the homework: The counted number stays the same even after screen rotation.

Question 1: If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device? Choose one:
A: The counter is reset to 0, but the contents of the EditText is preserved.

Question 2: What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs? Choose one:
A: Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().

Question 3: When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called? Choose one:
A: onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.

Question 4: Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed? Choose one:
A: onPause() or onStop()
