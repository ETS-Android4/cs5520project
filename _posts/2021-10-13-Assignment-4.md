Within this assignment, I used the Room database to save the tasks which can persist even after closing and restarting the app. In addition, I made use of data binding to connect data with layouts in order to store and create new to-do tasks. I spent around 10 hours on the previously mentioned tasks. However, I was not able to complete the feature to edit an existing task before 14th of October. Fortunately that feature is completed and everything works normally on 19th October. Currently, this app allows users to create a new task, and save the task's title and description in the Room database, and allow user to edit it afterwards. In terms of future improvements, we can try to save more attributes regarding a task including its deadline date and time, tags and such.

Several Screenshots of the current app are as follow.
