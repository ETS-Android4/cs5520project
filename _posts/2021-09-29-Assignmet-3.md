In this assignment, I started on creating a new to-do android app. On the main page, I created a recycler view that contains a list of to-do tasks that are shown in card views.
After clicking the "+" button, it will navigate to the page where users can create a new task by entering multiple parameters. And after clicking "save", they will return to the main page and the newly created task will be shown on the main page as well.
